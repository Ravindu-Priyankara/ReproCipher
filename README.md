#### <font color="yellow">ReproCipher is a simple encryption algorithm which uses substitution cipher. However, it is not a completely traditional substitution cipher; I have implemented it using basic Python operations.</font>

## Installation

To install ReproCipher, clone the repository using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Ravindu-Priyankara/ReproCipher.git`


## Usage

Navigate to the `ReproCipher` directory:

`cd ReproCipher`

`cd cipher`


<font color="orange">Then, create a Python file and import the module like this:</font>

```python
from ReproCipher import Cipher
```

<font color="orange">After that, pass the values to ReproCipher like this:</font>

```python
from ReproCipher import Cipher

Cipher(text="pass data to encrypt", key="if you need a key, pass a key. It should be an integer between 0 and 26")
```

## Conclusion

This tool is designed to provide insight into developing custom encryption for projects. However, it is important to note that substitution cipher is considered weak and should not be used for real-world applications. For stronger encryption solutions, please follow my GitHub profile, where I will update with projects as soon as possible.
